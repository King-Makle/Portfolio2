    description: 'Visual branding efforts—designing event flyers, managing social media, and creating apparel to unify Delta Sigs identity across all platforms.',
    fullDescription: `Delta Sigma Phi is a nationally recognized fraternity, and during my time as an undergraduate member, I took on a creative leadership role that touched nearly every visual aspect of our chapter. I produced a wide range of content—from social media graphics and recruitment videos to philanthropy flyers, apparel designs, and even a printed memory book and chapter composite.

For a period of time, I managed the fraternity's social media accounts, translating ideas from non-designers into fully realized visual campaigns. This required adaptability and creative problem-solving, as I moved between mediums like print, digital, and merchandise—often within the same campaign. Whether I was designing a hoodie for a brotherhood event or coordinating cohesive graphics across Instagram, flyers, and tabling materials, the goal was always the same: create work that reflected the chapter's identity and resonated with our audience.

The volume and variety of content I developed went far beyond what could fit on one page. But every piece played a role in building a more unified, professional, and engaging presence for the chapter—both online and on campus.`,

    fullDescription: `Secret Typography is an experimental 3D design project exploring the power of type as a form of rebellion, identity, and unspoken protest. Inspired by Pablo Neruda's Ode to Typography, the project fuses poetic language with graffiti—rendered in 3D to physically emerge from the flatness of traditional poster design.

This hybrid visual language is meant to evoke the tension between structure and subversion, using extrusion, shadow, and form to amplify typographic voice. The final piece was presented as a triptych of posters, layered with graffiti-like markings extruded in 3D and digitally composited to create depth and disruption.`,
